# Skills Test 1 (the real thing)

____

# Setup

Do a fresh "git pull" to get the skills test files.
The files you just got from your "git pull" are:
 
 + README.md (this text file with instructions)
 + README.html (fancy version of this file)
 + cleaned_covid_data.csv
 + prepare_data.R (the script I used to turn all the raw data files into cleaned_covid_data.csv - only for the curious)
 + data/ (directory containing all the raw data files - only for the curious)

# Data description

**cleaned_covid_data.csv is the main data file you will use for this skills test.**

The columns in the cleaned_covid_data.csv file are as follows:

| Column name              | Description                                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| "Province_State"         | State (or DC)                                                                 |
| "Last_Update"            | Date of observation                                               |
| "Confirmed"              | Cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases as of the given date            |
| "Deaths"                 | The date the DNA was originally extracted in the format YYYY-MM-DD            |
| "Recovered"              | Total number of recovered cases as of the given date                          |
| "Active"                 | Total number of active confirmed COVID-19 cases as of the given date          |
| "Case_Fatality_Ratio"    | Percent of cases that resulted in death due to COVID-19                       |

A glimpse of the data structure:
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
df <- read_csv("cleaned_covid_data.csv")
skimr::skim(df)
```

# YOUR TASKS:

**I.**
**Read the cleaned_covid_data.csv file into an R data frame. (20 pts)**

cleaned_covid_data <- read.csv("cleaned_covid_data.csv")

**II.**
**Subset the data set to just show states that begin with "A" and save this as an object called A_states. (20 pts)**

 + Use the *tidyverse* suite of packages
 + Selecting rows where the state starts with "A" is tricky (you can use the grepl() function or just a vector of those states if you prefer)

library(tidyverse)
 A_states<- df %>%
filter(grepl("^A", Province_State))
View(A_states)
 
**III.**
**Create a plot _of that subset_ showing Deaths over time, with a separate facet for each state. (20 pts)**

 + Create a scatterplot
 + Add loess curves WITHOUT standard error shading
 + Keep scales "free" in each facet

ggplot(A_states)+
geom_point(aes(x=Last_Update, y=Deaths))+
geom_smooth(aes(x=Last_Update, y=Deaths),method="loess", se=FALSE)+
facet_wrap("Province_State", scales="free")

**IV.** (Back to the full dataset)
**Find the "peak" of Case_Fatality_Ratio for each state and save this as a new data frame object called state_max_fatality_rate. (20 pts)**

I'm looking for a new data frame with 2 columns:

 + "Province_State"
 + "Maximum_Fatality_Ratio"
 + Arrange the new data frame in descending order by Maximum_Fatality_Ratio
 
This might take a few steps. Be careful about how you deal with missing values!

df_col<-df%>%
select(-Recovered,-Active, -Deaths,-Confirmed, -Last_Update)
View(df_col)

state_max_fatality_rate <- df %>%
group_by(Province_State) %>%
summarize(max_fatality_rate = max(Case_Fatality_Ratio, na.rm = TRUE))%>%
arrange(desc(max_fatality_rate))

View(state_max_fatality_rate)

**V.**
**Use that new data frame from task IV to create another plot. (20 pts)**

 + X-axis is Province_State
 + Y-axis is Maximum_Fatality_Ratio
 + bar plot
 + x-axis arranged in descending order, just like the data frame (make it a factor to accomplish this)
 + X-axis labels turned to 90 deg to be readable
 
Even with this partial data set (not current), you should be able to see that (within these dates), different states had very different fatality ratios.


state_max_fatality_rate$Province_State<- factor(state_max_fatality_rate$Province_State, levels=state_max_fatality_rate$Province_State[order(-state_max_fatality_rate$max_fatality_rate)])

ggplot(state_max_fatality_rate, aes(x=Province_State, y=max_fatality_rate))+
geom_bar(stat="identity", fill='darkgreen')+
labs(title="Max Fatality Rate Per State",
x= "State",
y= "Fatality Rate")+
theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))


**VI.** (BONUS 10 pts)
**Using the FULL data set, plot cumulative deaths for the entire US over time**

 + You'll need to read ahead a bit and use the dplyr package functions group_by() and summarize() to accomplish this.

deaths_over_time <- df %>%
group_by(Last_Update) %>%
summarize(Total_Deaths = sum(Deaths, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
arrange(Last_Update)

deaths_over_time$Last_Update <- as.POSIXct(deaths_over_time$Last_Update)

ggplot(deaths_over_time, aes(x = Last_Update, y = Total_Deaths)) +
geom_line(color = "red") +
labs(title = "Deaths Over Time",
      x = "Date",
      y = "Deaths")
