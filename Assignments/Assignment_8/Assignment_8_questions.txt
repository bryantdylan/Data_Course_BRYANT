#Upload responses to the following as a numbered plaintext document to Canvas:
  #1. Are any of your predicted response values from your best model scientifically meaningless? Explain.
## Based on the summary statistics of the best model (model6), nitrogen was found to be statistically meaningless because the p-value in the summary
#table was greater than 0.05 which is considered insignificant. 

  #2. In your plots, did you find any non-linear relationships? Do a bit of research online and give a link to at least one resource explaining how to deal with modeling non-linear relationships in R.
# It appears that temperature and nitrogen exhibit non-linear relationships. The following websites provide information to help handle these non-linear relationships:
#https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/non-linear-regression-in-r/
#https://tuos-bio-data-skills.github.io/intro-stats-book/non-linear-regression-in-R.html
#https://www.econometrics-with-r.org/8.1-a-general-strategy-for-modelling-nonlinear-regression-functions.html

  #3. Write the code you would use to model the data found in “/Data/non_linear_relationship.csv” with a linear model (there are a few ways of doing this)
non_lin<-read.csv("C:/Users/bryan/OneDrive/Documents/BIOL_3100/Data_Course_BRYANT/Data/non_linear_relationship.csv")
View(non_lin)


ggplot(non_lin, aes(x = predictor, y = response)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", color = "red", se = TRUE)

#model
poly_model <- lm(response ~ poly(predictor, 2), data = data)
summary(poly_model)

quad_mod<-lm(response ~ poly(predictor, 2), data=non_lin)
summary(quad_mod)

mse_quad <- mean(residuals(quad_mod)^2)
cat("MSE for Model:", mse_quad, "\n")
