Describe your idea for a data analysis final project

	For my final project, I am going to analyze various spatial characteristics of Rock Glacier in Utah. I am going to focus on one geologic quad and use Rock glaciers that I have plotted for my research project.
	Some of the characteristics that I would like to analyze are slope, aspect, area, length, width, and elevation. I would like to see if there are relationships between location, spatial characteristics and rock glacier size.

Describe the sort of data you will use, potential sources, and what the data might look like
	I will need two types of data for this project. Spatial data in the form of either shapefiles or kmz files of the rock glacier locations as polygons. I will also create spreadsheet data of the spatial characteristics such as area, elevation, and slope aspect. 
	The data will have mostly numeric data, but some data will be characters/factors. Much of the data I will extract from the spatial information of the shapefile polygons.
